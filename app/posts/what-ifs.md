Medieval Estonia, 1342.

I wonder if we'll ever be able to establish a new standard for doing things more efficiently. Working long hours in this harsh winter is something I wouldn't wish on anyone, and as usual, my uncle is sick, so I'm having to work twice as hard now.

Since I was 12, I've been thinking about getting my family out of this job that seems to be getting worse and worse. Taxes keep rising, and the amount we produce remains the same.

Some time ago, I had a dream about a giant mill spinning. I can't explain how or why, but I felt strongly that it was a message from Saint George. He protects us.

Sleepless nights have become silent companions. While most of the village men succumbed to exhaustion (from overwork) or cheap liquor, I pored over old parchments stolen from the priest's library, observing the rudimentary gears of the watermills that barely ground our grain. Saint George's message seemed to whisper in every creak of the wood, in every slow turn of the blades. It wasn't an ordinary mill, I knew. It was something more... extraordinary.

Ideas began to flow like the water of the river that runs alongside our plantation. One day, while plowing the land, I was thinking about how to instruct the natural forces of things to my advantage. I couldn't simply pull and push levers or mechanisms; after all, the work would be hard. My grandfather died at 46 and taught me a little about carving wood (as had my late father), and one day I realized I could simply instruct the mechanisms with carved wood. I simply couldn't wait to create.

I began with wooden planks carved secretly in the dead of night, tiny gears I polished with pebbles, and intricate channels carved with the tip of a rusty, improvised knife. My aunt watched me with concern, the feverish glint in my eyes attributed to hunger or fatigue. I let her think so. It was better for her to consider me mad than a sorcerer.

Months passed. The calloused hands of a farmer became the delicate hands of a shoemaker, assembling parts with almost supernatural precision. The mechanism, as I called it, grew in the abandoned barn. It was a structure of wood, copper, and small lead weights that moved in response to the flow of water channeled from a nearby stream. Each gear, each lever, each valve represented an operation, an instruction, a condition.

The winter of 1342 turned into the spring of 1343, a year that would become bitter for our land. The Teutonic Order's taxes crushed us, the harvests remained meager, and the revolt of Saint George was in the air. But in my barn, a mechanical miracle was about to happen.

Finally, the day arrived. With a nervousness that made me tremble, I tapped the main inlet to run water to my device. The gears began to turn smoothly, the sound of tiny clicks filling the air. Droplets of water ran through small tubes, activating levers that, in turn, opened and closed irrigation gates on a small plot of land I had prepared. The mechanism didn't just irrigate; it did so with a precision we could never achieve manually, measuring time and quantity with a divine intelligence.

It was... perfect. The seeds sprouted faster, the plants grew stronger. The mechanism promised to free my family, my village, from the servitude of the land. I saw a future where hard work was replaced by the silent dance of gears.

With my heart pounding, I arranged a meeting with Vanaisa, the village's most respected elder, a wise and skeptical, yet fair man. He listened to me with an unreadable expression as I described my dream, Saint George, and the mechanism that would make the water "work."

"It's a blessing, Vanaisa!" I exclaimed, guiding him to the barn. "It's the answer to our prayers, a tool to free us from hunger and oppression!"

The dim light of the elder's torch illuminated my creation. He observed the intricate tangle of wood and copper, the drops of water moving with precision, the irrigation gates opening and closing on their own. Silence. A heavy, oppressive silence. Vanaisa reached out a wrinkled, hesitant hand, almost touching one of the gears.

Suddenly, he jerked away with a guttural scream. His once-wise eyes were wide with horror.

"This... this is not Saint George's," he whispered, his voice thick with ancient dread. "This is the work of the Devil. An abomination. A device to steal the souls of men and the blessing of the earth."

Before I could argue, he threw the torch to the ground. The fire spread quickly, licking at the dry wooden walls of the barn. My device, the fruit of years of sweat, dreams, and secrets, began to smolder.

The sound of crackling wood and the grinding of gears mingled with Vanaisa's shout of "Wizard!", calling out to the other villagers.

I saw my sick uncle murdered in cold blood with a flail that struck his head in the temple, causing his brains to explode. His eyes popped out.

All for my creation. They didn't see the progress; they saw the ruin, the heresy.

I heard screams and insults until at some point I felt my end. A trident pierced my back to my navel. My intestines spilled out, and that was the end. The pain was so great and my scream so shrill that I no longer had the strength to continue.
