                I am a software engineer focused on building secure, efficient, and resilient systems. I value free and open-source software, decentralized technologies, and infrastructure that prioritizes user autonomy. I use whatever programming language or tool best fits the problem—what matters is clarity, maintainability, and performance.

                <br />
                I’m exploring areas like applied cryptography, compute performance and low leve programming languages like C, Assembly and Verilog/VHDL.
